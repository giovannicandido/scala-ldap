# scala-ldap

This project is a wrapper for UnboundID SDK to ldap access in a more scala idiomatic way.

Is relative simple and battle tested in one mission critical product app as the underline communication ldap protocol.

It take me a long time to publish this library, and I'm not maintaining anymore, I almost forgot about it. 
But fell free to contact if this stuff is usefull for you (ldap is a pain in the a** :-), I will be happy ;-)
