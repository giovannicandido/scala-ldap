# Scala Ldap

This project is a wrapper for UnboundID SDK to ldap access in a more scala idiomatic way.

Is relative simple and battle tested in one mission critical product app as the underline communication ldap protocol.

A long time as been passed to publish this library, and I'm not maintaining anymore, I almost forgot about it. 
But fell free to contact if this stuff is usefull for you I will be happy ;-) (ldap is a pain in the a** :-)

# Getting started

Start looking at the specs for RDN, and see the beauty and possibilities of scala lang:

Instead of:

```
"cn=bla,ou=users,dc=domain,dc=local"
```

Which is error prone, annoying and we do ALL the time.

Do:

```
CN("bla") / OU("users") / DC("domain") / DC("local")
```

Whichi is safe, and compile time checked, you can rest assure that any code with a DN parameter will work:

```
val manager = getManager
      val entry = new LdapEntry(CN("user") / CN("Users") / dc, Some(List(new LdapAttribute("objectClass: top"))))
      val success = manager.add(entry)
      success.isSuccess must beTrue
      val result = manager.lookup(CN("user"), CN("Users") / dc)

      result.isDefined should beTrue

      result.get.dn must beEqualTo(entry.dn)

      val deleteResult = manager.delete(entry.dn)
      deleteResult.isSuccess must beTrue

      val result2 = manager.lookup(entry.dn)
      result2.isDefined should beFalse
```

LdapManager class will do operations in ldap. And did I mention that it handles the connection open close in for us?

Take a look at `LdapManagerSpec`

```
val result = ldapManager.withConnection(f => {
        f.isConnected must beTrue
        c = f
        LdapResult(0, "Fake")
      })
```

The connection will be properly handled, no matter what happens (any exeception). If you do too many connections this could be problematic, one improviment not implemented is to create a pool, but you could just keep the connection opened and close manually:

```
"configure to create only one connection in the lifecycle of object" in {
      val ldapManager = getManagerWithPersistentConnection
      val connection1 = ldapManager.connect
      val connection2 = ldapManager.connect
      connection1.isSuccess must beTrue
      connection2.isSuccess must beTrue
      connection1.get.getConnectionID must beEqualTo(connection2.get.getConnectionID)
      var connectionId1: Long = 0
      var connectionId2: Long = 1
      ldapManager.withConnection(f => {
        f.isConnected must beTrue
        connectionId1 = f.getConnectionID
        LdapResult(0, "Fake")
      })
      ldapManager.withConnection(f => {
        f.isConnected must beTrue
        connectionId2 = f.getConnectionID
        LdapResult(0, "Fake")
      })
      ldapManager.closeConnection
      connectionId1 must equalTo(connectionId2)

    }
```


Also, every operation return a LdapResult if is atomic, or SearchResult if has some results, which makes map operations better.

Every object is a `LdapEntry`, which add some godies on the valila LdapEntry of UnboundID. Check `LdapEntrySpec`

You could do things like:

```
"find attribute by name" in {
      ldapEntry.findAttributeByName("displayName").head must equalTo(new LdapAttribute("displayname","value"))
      ldapEntry.findAttributeByName("Non exists").isEmpty must beTrue
    }
    "find attribute by name ignoring ranges" in {
      ldapEntry.findAttributeByName("member").head.value must equalTo(Some("member"))
    }
    "see if has a attribute with the given name and value" in {
      ldapEntry.hasAttributeWithValue("displayName","value") must beTrue
      ldapEntry.hasAttributeWithValue("displayName","false") must beFalse
    }
    "return the first attribute with a given name" in {
      ldapEntry.getFirstAttributeValueWithName("displayName") must beSome("value")
    }
    "ignore case of attribute in hasAttributeWithValue" in {
      ldapEntry.hasAttributeWithValue("displAyNaMe","value") must beTrue
    }
    
    "findAttributByName return multiple attributes" in {
          val ldapEntry = LdapEntry(CN("1234") / OU("test"), Some(Seq(LdapAttribute("member","value"), LdapAttribute("member;range=0-1499","member"))))
          val attributes = ldapEntry.findAttributeByName("member")
          attributes  must have size(2)
          attributes must contain(LdapAttribute("member", "value"))
    }
    
    "implement equals and hashcode correctly" in {
      val a = LdapEntry(CN("123") / OU("test"), Some(Seq(new LdapAttribute("displayname","value"))))
      val b = LdapEntry(CN("123") / OU("test"), Some(Seq(new LdapAttribute("displayname","value"))))
      (a == b) must beTrue
      a.## mustEqual b.##
    }
    "be usable in collections" in {
      val a = LdapEntry(CN("123") / OU("test"), Some(Seq(new LdapAttribute("displayname","value"))))
      val b = LdapEntry(CN("124") / OU("test"), Some(Seq(new LdapAttribute("displayname","value"))))
      val seq = Seq(a,b)
      seq.find(_.dn == CN("123") / OU("test")) must beSome
    }
```

There is more, check the specs. Thanks :-)

If you are wondering, the app using this library syncs ~= 60.000 accounts every 2 days in the most dumb way: Batch.
As a result milions of operations have been done to Active Directory to date, taking 6-8 hours per sync, the app is very successfull on business, so it just works well. The problem offcouse is the constrains that made me do it in this dumb way.

An big improviment started but not completed, is to sync AD and do diff in SQL database, then apply only the operations that need in batch. This has been done for sync when removing or blocking accounts, but not in the main batch operations. As a result an operation which would take 6 hours now take less than a minute most of times.
